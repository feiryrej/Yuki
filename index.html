      <div class="base">
        <h3>Albedo</h3> <br>
        <p>In the tapestry of these challenging months, we find ourselves in an unexpected danceâ€”I, the sun, and you, my delicate snow. 
        <br>Despite the odds, there's a magnetic pull that refuses to let us part, a testament to a love too strong to be swayed. 
        <br>Your essence, akin to fresh, pure snow, beautifully mirrors your resilient spirit, reflecting the sunlight and standing unyielding in its glow. It's as if our connection has its own albedo, a radiant shield against the storms we've weathered. 
        <br> <br>In the face of hardship, your courage, resilience, and boundless love shine through, crafting a unique celestial narrative where the sun and snow coexist, not in conflict, but in a harmonious dance that defies expectations and celebrates the beauty of a love that remains unbroken, undiminished, and triumphant. <br>
        <h6>Happy 10th month, my love.</h6> </p>
